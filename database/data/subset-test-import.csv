Because the climatic factors are largely uncontrolled, the variables that influence crop production must be quantitatively evaluated if we want to explain adequately the effects of any climatic variable on cotton growth stages. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is a major row crop grown primarily for fiber and seed. The objective of this investigation was to develop Agroclimatic-Yield based regression models for estimation rain-fed cotton for Gharakhil district (Mazandaran Province, Iran) using available historical data. Twenty-Seven years (from 1985 to 2011) historical cotton yield data published by Gharakhil Agromet. Station (GAS) was related to climatological variables and agroclimatological indices to develop Agroclimate-Yield models. On the basis of correlation coefficient, F-statistics, standard error of estimate (r=0.455, F=4.431, SEOE=894 kg ha-1 for Logarithmic regression model and r=0.722, F=5.456, SEOE=739 kg ha-1 for Cubic regression model) and relative deviation (RD) of the selected years, the suitable time of estimation for cotton yield was found to be at the end of squaring stage i.e., July 19th (3 months before harvesting) using climatological and agroclimatological data/indices of the squaring stage (from June 28th to July 19th). The best agroclimatic subset were selected as Temperature Difference (TD) for Logarithmic and Rainfall (R) for Cubic model.","

During the last years, European government remuneration polices promoted the realisation of photovoltaic systems integrated with the structures instead of on ground photovoltaic (PV) plants. In this context, in rural areas, greenhouses covered with PV modules have been developed. In order to interdict the building of greenhouses with an amount of opaque panels on covering not coherent with the plant production, local laws assigned a threshold value, usually between 25% and 50%, of the projection on the soil of the roof. These ranges seem not to be based on scientific evaluation about the agricultural performances required to the building but only on empirical assessments. Purpose of this paper is to contribute to better understand the effect of different configurations of PV panels on the covering of a monospan duo-pitched roof greenhouse in terms of shading effect and energy efficiency during different periods of the year. At this aim, daylighting and insolation analysis were performed by means of the software Autodesk¬¨√Ü Ecotect¬¨√Ü Analysis (Autodesk, Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA) on greenhouse model with different covering ratio of polycrystalline photovoltaic panels on the roof.","

Studies on the national adaptation strategy of Tunisian agriculture to climate change reveal that this phenomenon will have serious implications on water resources, ecosystems and agro-systems by 2030. Successive droughts will reduce livestock numbers by 80% in central and southern regions and 20% in the North. In this context, we studied the reaction of the small ruminants farming systems to this critical situation. An investigation has been carried out in the north west of Tunisia (240 small ruminants farms in Jendouba governorate and 151 in Kef governorate). Farms typology results (by PCA) indicate the presence of three farms groups in Kef and three in Jendouba with different farm sizes and flock numbers. The common problem is feed availability. Frequent droughts and over-grazing explain why the involvement of natural pastures and rangelands in animal feed calendars are declining noticeably, justifying the frequent use of transhumance. Large amounts of concentrates are used especially in summer, reducing farmers' incomes improved by other activities. In forest zones, twigs of trees and shrubs constitute a very good food resource. Farmers practice late weaning to reduce the quantities of concentrates presented to the lambs in order to preserve their farm's sustainability.","

Intervention is incorporating these technologies were adopted in 55 farmers' fields during kharif of 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 in Khanapur taluk of Belgaum district in North Karnataka. A substantial improvement in the number of tillers, in spite of lower plant population and grains per panicle etc., were recorded due to adoption of resource conservation practices. Besides, there was a significant reduction in weed population and biomass. Rice yields were 15 per cent higher at much lower cost of cultivation. Zero Till practices reduced significantly seed rate, weed biomass etc. The profit under zero till was 28 per cent higher than that under farmers' practices. However, when untimely and torrential rains affect timely sowing, dry sowing remained as an alternative option. Cultivation on sloppy land and terraces with small holdings, without heavy machine (tractor) drawn still provide scope for zero till practices and require lower energy for farmers with smaller holdings.","

Based on spatial climatic data of agriculture and the experiment data, the models of agro-ecological assessment of climate for agricultural suitability in this study were developed using the fuzzy mathematical method. Three coefficients, including the resource coefficient (Cr), the efficiency coefficient (Ce), and the utility coefficient (K), were used in the models, which were calculated based on temperature, moisture, and sunshine duration data of Guanzhong region, Shaanxi Province. The results indicated that resource coefficient was higher in west of the region than that in east, and higher in south (especially in the Central Shaanxi Plain) than that in the Weibei plateau. The value of Cr changed from 6.5 to 9.2 from north to plain area. Spatial change of efficiency coefficient was obvious, lower in the northeast than in the central plain, and the value of Ce changed from 2.3 to 6.5 from the northeast to the central plain. As for utility coefficient, it was lower in northeastern part of the Weibei plateau and in southern mountain areas than that in the central plain, showing significant latitudinal zonality. Furthermore, the value of K increased from 0.35 to 0.78 from northeast to the central plain, and decreased from 0.78 to 0.53 from the central plain to southern mountain areas. These indicated that climate resource in the central plain region was more abundant and potential, compared with other regions. GuanZhong region was classified into three larger agricultural zones and three small independent zones, according to agro-ecological assessment. Light, heat and water resources should be made use of in an efficient way in spatial allocation of agricultural production. For example, water facilities should also be improved in Weibei plateau region where highly-qualified fruit should be enhanced and fruit processing industrial chain should be shaped. Large-scale production area of wheat should be increased in central irrigation region and more vegetable bases should be developed around large and medium-scale cities. Thanks for outstanding water conservation function, the three-dimensional agriculture including medicine and other sideline production should be developed in Qinling Mountains and the specialized commercial agriculture should be accelerated in independent small zones, according to local conditions. In the research, different crop varieties were developed in corresponding regions as per current eco-climatic conditions.","

Climate Change in Pakistan among others manifests itself in temperature increases, rainfall reduction in the arid plains and increases in the monsoon areas and last but not least, accelerated glacial melt. All these and other developments call for a deeper insight into the effects Recent Climate Change - or Weather Change has had on Pakistan in the course of the last 17 years. In this context the threats to food security remain one core issue to be investigated based on productivity analysis. This article studies how climate change affects the agricultural productivity in Pakistan's four provinces Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and the N.W.F.P., measured as weighted food crop yields per hectare, for the food crops wheat, rice and maize. By considering the RABI (Nov-Apr) growing season and including a measure for drought to capture the occurrence of extreme events, exacerbated through climate change, the proposed hypothesis is that changing climatic variables have reduced and are reducing the agricultural productivity and thus posing a threat to long term food security. To depict the effect of climate change, several control variables are introduced in a panel framework for intertemporal analysis. As a result, we should expect lower levels of productivity in the arid zones with greater climatic pressure and adverse effects on food security through lower agricultural yields.","

Rainfed areas in Mexico accounts for 14 million hectares where around 23 million people live and are located in places where there is a little climatic information. The severe drought that has impacted northern Mexico in the past several years as well as other parts of the country, has forced decision takers to look for improved tools and procedures to prevent and to cope with this natural hazard. For this paper, the methodology of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for estimating water balance variables was modified to provide crop yield estimations under rainfed agriculture in maize producer states of Mexico. The water balance accounts for the daily variation of soil water content having main input rainfall (Pp) and main output crop evapotranspiration (Eta). The algorithm computes crop yield using two distinctive approaches: (1) one based on surplus/deficit functions for each crop considered and (2) yield estimations based on soil water balance and water function productions of the crop being analyzed. For computing water balance and crop yields, a computer model is built that incorporates the FAO method for water balance (MODEL SICTOD: Computational System for Decision Taking, acronym in Spanish) which stochastically generate precipitation based on wet/dry transition probabilities using a first order Markov chain scheme. Maps of average crop yields were obtained after interpolating model outcomes for the main maize producer states of Mexico: Jalisco, Michoacan, Guerrero, Puebla Oaxaca and Chiapas. Different planting dates were analyzed, early (90 days of length period), intermediate (120 days of length period) and late (150 days of length period). Crop yield variability correlates to the transition probability on having a wet day following a dry day. Results have shown high yield variation and probability of crop yield failure and climatic risk follows a distinctive pattern according to planting date and rainfall occurrence. The approach used is of great support for decision taking processes.","

The studied dimensions of the safety climate were sense of risk, optimism, pessimism, and contentment with the occupational safety and health (OSH) conditions. There were differences in the estimated perceptions among the different groups of farm workers. Workers who had experienced work-related accidents perceived their occupation and activity more dangerous than those who had not yet experience it. The farm workers were more pessimistic rather than optimistic in relation to organizational and general OSH conditions. They perceived that the OSH costs and conditions are uninteresting factors in this economic and organizational environment.

If mean temperature increases, in accordance with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections and adaptations and/or genetic modifications are not considered, suitable areas for farming corn (Zea mays) and coffee (Coffea arabica) will decrease in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil). Further, increases in precipitation will not be enough to ameliorate the impacts associated with increases in mean temperatures. Suitability for grain production will decrease more rapidly in regions with sandy soils than in regions with clay or medium soils, as the temperature increases. The projected increase in mean temperature of up to 5.8¬¨‚àûC would decrease the suitability for grain production drastically in spite of soil texture. Besides the reduction of suitable areas for coffee production, the projections suggest that changes will be more enhanced in the southeast of the state, especially in higher elevation regions, where farming practice, soils, and infrastructure are unsuitable for the economic production of coffee. In both cases, no compensatory increase in suitable areas for production is likely under current IPCC scenarios.","

This study employed a Ricardian model that captures farmers' adaptation to analyse the impact of climate change on South African sugarcane production under irrigation and dryland conditions. The study utilized time series data for the period 1977-98 pooled over 11 districts. Results showed that climate change has significant nonlinear impacts on net revenue per hectare of sugarcane in South Africa with higher sensitivity to future increases in temperature than precipitation. Irrigation did not prove to provide an effective option for mitigating climate change damages on sugarcane production in South Africa. The study suggests that adaptation strategies should focus special attention on technologies and management regimes that will enhance sugarcane tolerance to warmer temperatures during winter and especially the harvesting phases.,"

To realize this potential, a focus on women farmers is essential as these are most vulnerable to HIV infection, are responsible for most food-securing activities and have benefited least from agricultural innovations. Attention needs to be directed at understanding the specific constraints, needs and priorities of vulnerable women smallholder farmers in relation to intra-household dynamics so that appropriate technologies and extension strategies can be developed. Other strategies they identified as important if women are to benefit from technical change include involving women in all phases of a project cycle; improving the productivity of women's labour while addressing the constraints that result from drudgery; integrating both pre- and post harvest activities; ensuring women's access to and control over the new technology and its resulting benefits; and organizing women's groups to increase their bargaining power.","

Objective: The aim was to study CO2 emissions from energy consumption in agricultural production in Guangdong Province and put forward feasible reduction measures. Method: Based on the data from China Energy Statistical Yearbook and Guangdong Statistical Yearbook, CO2 emissions from agricultural energy use in Guangdong Province from 2000 to 2009 was estimated by using the formula of carbon emissions recommended by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and corresponding reduction measures were put forward. Result: With the rapid increase of agricultural output and energy consumption, CO2 emissions from energy consumption in agricultural production in Guangdong Province showed increasing trend from 2000 to 2009, that is to say, increasing from 423.63‚àö√≥104 t C million tons in 2000 to 605.99‚àö√≥104 t C in 2009, with annual growth rate of 4.1%. Meanwhile, carbon emissions intensity during energy consumption in agriculture went down in recent ten years, in other words, decreasing from 0.424 t C/ ‚àö√≥ 104 yuan in 2000 to 0.301 t C/ ‚àö√≥ 104 yuan in 2009, and its annual decreasing rate was 3.7%. The variation of CO2 emissions from energy consumption in agriculture mainly resulted from the increase of agricultural output, improvement of energy utilization efficiency, high carbonization in agricultural energy consumption structure and so forth. Therefore, in order to reduce CO2 emissions from energy consumption in agriculture, it is necessary to vigorously develop rural renewable energy, develop and popularize advanced technology for energy utilization, advance the energy conservation of agricultural machines, establish and improve the macroeconomic control mechanism for carbon emissions from the energy consumption in agricultural production in the further.

The Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF) is a commercial demonstration dairy farm achieving over 1700 kg MS/ha with 4.2 cows per hectare on a pasture based system. We compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from such a system with the ""typical dairy farm"". LUDF was a first adopter of nitrous oxide mitigation technology through the use of eco-n nitrification inhibitor. A full life cycle assessment for greenhouse gases within the farm gate was completed for the 2006-07 farming year. The LUDF produced milksolids with 11% lower GHG emissions/kg MS (kg CO2 eq/kg MS) than the typical NZ dairy farm, and when nitrification inhibitor mitigation was factored in for nitrous oxide this resulted in 21% lower emissions/kg MS. However the per hectare output of GHG was 51% higher than for the ""typical"" NZ dairy farm. This suggests that properly managed dairy farms with an emphasis on pasture utilisation and per cow and per hectare production, and the use of eco-n nitrification inhibitor, can lower GHG emissions per unit of output (milksolids) even if the per hectare output is higher than average, which demonstrates improved land utilisation.","

Taiwan Forestry Bureau (TFB) had set an afforestation policy in 2001 to encourage farmers or private organizations participating growing trees on cultivated land to enlarge the basis of forest coverage by supporting the seedlings and funds. This paper aimed to evaluate the benefits of carbon sequestration and wood production on the afforestation farm by the methods of integrating a sampling-based derived diameter distribution model and height model for the estimation of stock volume. From the pilot test on a volume-age model, an estimation bias was derived and used to correct the volume estimate of the 20-yrs farm forest. Results showed that carbon sequestration of the hardwoods cultivated in this area of 20 years is about 12,300 metric tons that can be exchanged in EU ETS carbon market making 2,172.79 US dollars income. Carbon sequestrated by rice or sugar cane will be discharged due to straw decomposition in soil for the improvement of soil quality; meanwhile growing sugar cane make no significant contribution to carbon sequestration due to almost all of the bagasse are used as fuel for sugar mills. Briefly, farm afforestation will make benefit totally 44,560 USD/ha or 45,672 USD/ha in a 20-yr period for wood production or carbon trading management respectively. Compare to farm sugar cane and rice, growing rice is least profitable but growing sugar cane is most profitable. Farming sugar cane for 20 years will make a benefit of 63,814 USD/ha which is 1.4 times greater than afforestation management.","

As urban atmosphere may be a harbinger for the future climate change with respect to temperature and CO2 concentration, the Seoul metropolitan area is unique in providing a natural CO2 dome with increased temperature due to its rapid urbanization and industrialization during the last several decades. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using the urban-rural environmental gradient in replacement of the IPCC mid-term scenario (after 30-50 years) at three sites with different extent of urbanization (Seoul, Suwon and Icheon). The annual mean temperature was 13.8, 13.7 and 12.7¬¨‚àûC in Seoul, Suwon, and Icheon, respectively, showing an urban-rural temperature gradient. The annual mean CO2 concentration across the 3 sites was in the order of Seoul (439 ppm) &gt; Suwon (419 ppm) &gt; Icheon (416 ppm), showing a substantial urban-rural environmental gradient. The observed CO2 concentration in Seoul has already reached 98% of the 2030-2040 projection (450 ppm) and 80% of the 2040-2050 projection (550 ppm) under the IPCC BAU scenario, suggesting a feasibility of using the temperature and CO2 dome of Seoul as a natural experimental setting for the midterm climate change impact assessment.

The two main sources were from enteric fermentation by ruminants and from manure management. This estimate which is primarily based on the IPCC methodology needs to be verified. Field measurements were recently undertaken to improve CH4 emission estimates. The backward Lagrangian Stochastic (bLS) technique, which provides emission estimates using concentration measurements and turbulence data obtained from an open-path laser and a three dimensional sonic anemometer, was used in a series of field experiments. Under ideal conditions, the model overestimated CH4 emissions by about 5% with a standard deviation of 21% and a standard error of 5%. For complex situations such as from a manure storage tank near a barn, where the confidence in the estimates based on the bLS technique is poor, CH4 was released from the manure storage tank, as a tracer gas, to calibrate the model. Results compare poorly with estimates of methane emissions based on the IPCC Tier 1 and Tier 2 methodologies. For a larger source, such as a feedlot, CO2 concentration measurements obtained with an aircraft-based system were used to estimate CO2 emissions. A mean value of 3.7 kg CO2 head-1 day-1 was obtained using a Gaussian plume model. With an appropriate CO2:CH4 production ratio, CH4 emissions from thousands of animals could be estimated.","

Agriculture contributes about 60% of New Zealand's total greenhouse gas emissions. Management practices for reducing these emissions will be required to meet our future international commitments. This paper presents estimates of two practical on-farm measures for reducing total greenhouse gas emissions from an average dairy farm on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand: (1) the incorporation of cereal silage into the diet, and (2) the strategic use of a stand-off pad in winter. Total calculated greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by about 14% if fertilizer N-boosted pasture was replaced with bought-in cereal silage grown off-farm. The estimated reduction in emissions was due to reductions in nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions, whereas methane emissions were not significantly affected by this management practice. Reduced methane emissions required an increase in per animal production and a corresponding decrease in stocking rate. The use of a stand-off pad during winter did not significantly affect total greenhouse gas emissions using current inventory calculations. However, recent research suggests that it may reduce emissions by 3-8%, when accounting for the seasonal variation in N2O emissions and reduced fertilizer N requirements due to reduced pasture damage. A preliminary assessment of the economic implications of the cereal silage option suggested the cost of using cereal silage is likely to be higher than any savings that could be accrued from carbon credits obtained from reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the costs associated with building and using a stand-off pad are likely to be off-set against a potential increase in pasture production, and carbon credits obtained from a reduction in greenhouse gas emission would represent a net cost saving."," Dimensions: Greenhouse gas emissions, Nitrous oxide emissions, Carbon dioxide emissions, Methane emissions

Climate variability exposes agricultural producers to considerable risks because outcomes of decisions cannot be confidently predicted. Historically, agrometeorological information has been utilised by managers of production systems to make farming systems somewhat resilient to variable climates. However, this information is often not available to producers in forms that they can readily access and use in their production systems. This paper describes the National Agricultural Monitoring System (NAMS), a tool being developed to bring together: information and data on historical climate variability; contextual factors such as land use and soil type; the impact of climatic variation on a variety of agricultural production systems at the regional level; and economic information on farm performance. The impetus to develop this tool came from a need to provide support to the Australian Government's drought programs. However, the potential of this tool to provide valuable real-time climatic and production information to producers was recognised early by a decision to make the information freely available via a website. It is envisioned that producers will be able to use the information provided by NAMS to assist in management decisions by being better able to judge and assess the risks to production systems posed by climate variability. The development of NAMS has involved extensive collaboration with major stakeholder groups including the Australian, State and Territory governments, which has helped ensure that the tool has strong support from its key users and that it is a valuable tool for individuals outside of its target audience.","

Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), resulting from human activities are substantially enhancing the greenhouse effect, which is alleged to increase the average temperature of the earth's surface. Conventional agricultural practices, like ploughing, mixing crop residue and other biomass into the soil surface and burning of residues, have contributed to the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as this is related to the mineralization and decomposition processes of soil organic matter by micro-organisms. A clear indicator of this is the decline in soil organic matter, which was estimated to be reduced in average with 50% in the soils of Rio Grande do Sul in hardly 15 years of conventional tillage. However, the emergence, development and improvement of new systems of land preparation and land management, in short conservation agriculture, have changed this balance. Systems, based on high crop residue addition and no tillage, tend to accumulate more carbon in the soil, compared to the loss into the atmosphere. This turns the soil into a net sink of carbon. The figures presented confirm the potential of conservation agriculture for carbon sequestration, or at least reduce the amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Assuming an average accumulation of 1.0 t C ha-1 year-1, an area like southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran‚àö¬∞) under cultivation, applying the three principles of conservation agriculture (no mechanical soil disturbance, permanent soil cover and crop rotations) would have the potential to sequester 8 million tonnes of C annually, which corresponds with 29 million tonnes atmospheric carbon dioxide.","

An econometrically estimated family of response functions is developed for characterizing potential responses to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies by the agriculture and forestry sectors in the USA. The response functions are estimated based on results of an agricultural/forestry sector model. They provide estimates of sequestration and emission reductions in forestry and agriculture along with levels of sectoral production, prices, welfare, and environmental attributes given a carbon (C) price, levels of demand for agricultural goods, and the energy price. Six alternative mitigation policies representing types of GHG offsets allowed are considered. Results indicate that the largest quantity of GHG offset consistently appears with the mitigation policy that pays for all opportunities. Restricting C payments (emission tax or sequestration subsidy) only to aff/deforestation or only to agricultural sequestration substantially reduces potential mitigation. Higher C prices lead to more sequestration, less emissions, reduced consumer and total welfare, improved environmental indicators and increased producer welfare.","

In this study, the soil water balance sub-model of CYRUS with some modifications was applied for estimating the value of runoff on 0-16% slopes (with interval of 2%) in five locations in Iran. The cumulated runoff over six months was, on average, 62, 52, 14, 13 and 4 mm for Shiraz, Kermanshah, Mashhad, Tabriz and Isfahan, respectively. Compared to Kermanshah, the value of runoff was higher for Shiraz in December, January and February, while runoff in March, April and May was lower for Shiraz than for Kermanshah. Based on the value of runoff for the month in which chickpea was planted (ploughing the soil and consequently making it more erodible), Shiraz appeared to be more at risk for cultivation in sloping farms as compared with Kermanshah. For Mashhad and Tabriz, runoff was found to be sensible in March, April and May, but not in others. Averaged over slopes and locations, the frequency of heavy runoffs was found to be higher in January and March, compared with other months. The incrementing effect of slope on runoff in January was higher for Shiraz, as compared to Kermanshah, but in March it was lower for Shiraz than for Kermanshah. In April, runoff was more sensible for Mashhad, when compared with Shiraz. Generally, results suggest that for Shiraz and Kermanshah, very low sloping farms should be devoted to cultivation. In addition, the cultivation of spring crops should be substituted by winter crops; for situations in which spring-crops are dominantly cultivated, the sowing of spring-crops for which dormant sowing is achievable, could be preferred. These substitutions can coincide more vegetation covered-soil with heavy runoffs and consequently decrease soil erosion.","

This study was conducted to develop a remote monitoring system for surveying farmer's greenhouse management. The remote monitoring system consisted of a database, a web-server, a main control unit (MCU) and several sensors (internal and external air temperature, internal relative humidity, internal soil temperature, internal and external solar radiation). The main controller has a CDMA modem, so it notifies the greenhouse status as well as emergency to farmers, and sends data to the database server at NHRI. The greenhouse status and emergency alarm can be sent to farmers by SMS message or ARS voice mail. The data obtained from the sensors can be sent to the server through a mobile communication company every 10 minutes and be built as a database. Database will be up-loaded onto the homepage and the homepage will provide the monitored environmental data and statistic data to farmers. Farmers can identify their greenhouse environments on the internet homepage. This system was installed in 100 farms (50 cucumber and tomato farms, respectively) all over Korea. As the survey of a factor which makes a difference in yield between high 10% and low 10% farms, the amount of internal solar radiation was most different. To estimate tomato and cucumber yield for overall farmers, we analyzed the relationship between yield and farmers' greenhouse environments using the panel regression analysis considering farm-specific effects. In tomato, the coefficient of determinant was about 0.51, and average soil temperature and internal temperature 2 weeks ago were most influencing yields. In cucumber, the coefficient of determinant was about 0.48, and internal temperature 2 weeks ago and external temperature were most influencing yields. But the relationship between yield and farmers' greenhouse environments was not so clear."," Dimensions: Sustainable agriculture and food systems, UNCLEAR

The aim of this article is to evaluate a practical method for estimating nitrogen emissions on the scale of a group of farms, to be used in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The method rests on the estimation of nitrogen inputs and outputs to calculate the surplus of the annual nitrogen balance on the scale of a farm. The different gaseous nitrogen losses (NH3, NO, N2O, N2) are then estimated for each livestock or cropping system. The leaching losses in the form of NO3 are assumed to correspond to the surplus of the apparent nitrogen balance to which are added the atmospheric depositions, minus the gaseous losses. The feasibility of this method was studied on 24 farms in the Naizin catchment area (Brittany, France). An analysis of the sensitivity of NO3 estimates to different parameters used to calculate gaseous losses was carried out. Lastly the robustness of the NO3 estimates was examined by comparing them with measurements of NO3 collected within this catchment area."," Dimensions: Sustainable agriculture and food systems, UNCLEAR

Sixty-five monitoring stations in 1996-1998 measured the total amount and chemical composition of atmospheric pollution and atmospheric deposition. The concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is the most important gaseous emission as it can be used as an indicator of the emission effects on agricultural production in the Czech Republic. The spatial distribution of atmospheric pollution, individual pollutant deposition and spatial distribution of soils and plants contamination are summarized in digital maps. The significance of sulfur dioxide as an indicator of emission effects on the crop production was reduced after extensive desulphurization of Czech industry, and therefore the significance of other parameters was increased (surface ozone, dry and wet deposition of hazardous substances, organic pollution, heavy metals, etc.). Unfortunately, the data from investigation of atmospheric deposition and plant indicators have not proved adequate for determination of legislative limits and it is necessary to continue long-term monitoring. The uses of emissions monitoring data are summarized.","

49,415750828,gpt_checked,"Zimbabwe: climate change impacts on maize production and adaptive measures for the agricultural sector. The results of the crop vulnerability and adaptation element of a Zimbabwean country study are reported. Global Climate Models (GCMs) and dynamic crop growth models were used to assess the potential effects of climate change on agriculture in Zimbabwe, with effects estimated for maize. Maize production is increasingly coming under stress due to high temperature and low rainfall conditions. Projected climate change causes simulated maize yields to decrease dramatically under dryland conditions in some regions (in some cases up to 30%), even under full irrigation conditions. The reduction in modelled maize yields are primarily attributed to temperature increases that shorten the crop growth period, particularly the grain-filling period. Broadly speaking, the duration of crop growth becomes shorter, thereby causing dramatic negative effects on yields. The simulated yield decreases in some regions are partially offset by the effect of increased carbon dioxide on plant physiology. There are several potential adaptation strategies that may be used to offset the negative impacts of climate change on maize yields. These include switching to drought-tolerant small grains and maize varieties, and appropriate management practices. Some farmers might suffer because of relatively severe local climatic changes, while farmers in other areas might benefit through improved yields and/or higher prices as a result of favourable local climatic conditions. Rapid geographical shifts in the agricultural land base could disrupt rural communities and their associated infrastructure. More research is required to generate technologies that equip farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change."," Dimensions: Climate change impacts on maize production, Adaptive measures for the agricultural sector,

When power is supplied to the controller the current air temperature is read, stored for mean temperature calculation and compared with previous max. or min. values. At the control interval it is compared with the desired value setting; if the error exceeds plus or minus 0.1 deg C a change of ventilator or steam valve position is called for; when the required position is reached a programme interrupt is generated. The system has been used in a compartmented greenhouse having a high speed hot water heating system and hinged ventilators, the steam valve and ventilating motors being connected to the controller through solid state relay interfaces. Although only limited performance data have so far been collected, it appears that the control achieved is at least as good as that obtained by analogue control systems.

In this study we present a spatial assessment tool for two paludiculture species, namely Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia. This tool is built in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and is designed to perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cultivation potential of land that is currently used for agriculture or peat extraction, within a defined geographical area. It uses a graded assessment process with a plot based analysis. A case study application shows that the tool can deliver first estimates of the potential cultivation area, but further research is needed to enhance its flexibility and scope of application.

However, the potential to mitigate some of these emissions through the adoption of more efficient farm management practices may be hampered by farmers' awareness and attitude towards climate change and agriculture's role in contributing to GHG emissions. This paper presents results from a survey of 746 Irish farmers in 2014, with a view to understanding farmers' awareness of, and attitudes to, climate change and GHG emissions. Survey results show that there was a general uncertainty towards a number of questions related to agricultural GHG emissions, e.g. if tilling of land causes GHG emissions, and that farmers were reluctant to take action to reduce GHG emissions on their farm. To further explore farmers' attitudes towards climate change, a multinomial logit model was used to examine the socio-economic factors that affect farmers' willingness to adopt an advisory tool that would show the potential reduction in GHG emissions from the adoption of new technologies. Results show that farmers' awareness of human-induced global climate change was positively related to the tool's adoption.","

The hardest hit from these climate extremes are women farmers with low adaptive capacity. This study explored women farmers' perceived indices of occurrence and severity of observed climate extremes in rural Ghana. Employing the qualitative method approach, eight focus group discussions and 15 interviews were conducted with women farmers under Centre for Alleviation of Poverty, Environment and Child Support GROW Project. The study adopted the thematic analytical approach for the data analysis. The results of the study revealed that the occurrence of drought, flood and bush fires has been an annual phenomenon over the past decade. In terms of severity, women farmers also reported that climate extremes, when they occurred, were very intense, especially drought and bush fires. The results further indicated that rainfall and temperature variations were markedly observed with the prediction of rainfall in particular becoming extremely difficult. Evidently, women farmers observed that climate extremes were caused by deforestation, bush fires and neglect of veneration of ancestral spirits. Importantly, the study found that women have devised their own means of responding to climate extremes to include support networks, savings and spiritual assistance from ancestors for rain when there was prolonged drought. The study recommends the need for the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment Science and Technology to forecast and display information on the yearly occurrence and severity of drought, flood and bush fires to complement women's local knowledge in decision making.","

Tropical forests provide enormous ecological and economic value. The potential is rapidly growing for carbon markets to deliver private and public compensation for emissions reductions from forest protection at national and subnational scales. Nevertheless, monetization of forest ecosystem services remains scant, leaving forests vulnerable to conversion to other land uses in the short run. We develop a real options framework for a representative farmer's land-use decisions, identifying a value gap between private short-term incentives versus long-term benefits from carbon market compensation, given uncertainties over future values for emissions reductions from forest protection. A quantitative illustration of this framework for Mato Grosso, Brazil, demonstrates that forest conservation coupled with cattle ranching intensification is competitive with the predominant practice of extensive cattle production, but is hindered by landholders' perceptions of the relative option values to different land uses. We show how bonds, call and put options allow for early monetization of part of potential future carbon revenues, even under uncertainty, changing incentives at the landholder level and jumpstarting conservation and more efficient models of agricultural production. These approaches provide a model for addressing the financial needs of farmers on the ground to accelerate the transition towards low-deforestation rural development at large scales.","

Climate data for the Olifants catchment (1986-2015) were also collected to validate farmers' perception of climate change with actual climate trend. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Kendall trend, Sen's slope estimator and multinomial logit regression model. Results revealed that smallholder farmers are aware of climate change (98%), their perception of these changes aligns with actual meteorological data, as the Mann-Kendall test confirms a decreasing inter-annual rainfall trend (-0.172) and an increasing temperature trend (0.004). These changes in temperature and precipitation have prompted the adoption of various adaptation responses, among which the use of improved seeds, application of chemical fertilizer and changing planting dates were the most commonly practised. The main barriers to the adoption of adaptation strategies were lack of access to credit facility, market, irrigation, information about climate change and lack of extension service. The implication of this study is to provide information to policy-makers on the current adaptation responses adopted by farmers and ways in which their adaptive capacity can be improved in order to ensure food security."," Dimensions: Climate change, livelihood of rural farmers, smallholder farmers' perception of climate change, adaptation strategies, factors that influence adaptive decisions

This would enable the authors to identify agricultural practices, assess vulnerability to climate change, identify options for improving agricultural systems from a climate change mitigation and adaptation perspective and finally provide climate-smart agricultural options. Design/methodology/approach The study used household survey methods of data collection. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire survey by interviewing 250 farm households, subdivided using three axes of the Yangambi landscape. Fisher's exact test was used to determine relationships between two or more variables. Findings Results of the survey revealed that the vast majority (98%) of respondents perceived changes in temperature, rainfall and weather patterns. Reduction of crop yields and the emergence of new weed species and new crop pests are the main impacts on agricultural activities. Although 87.6% of respondents have no means of adaptation and resilience, some of them use crops rotation, fallow practice, fertilizers and bio-pesticides. A framework for CSA is proposed for the Yangambi landscape. Practical implications Policies and strategies to promote CSA in the study area should take into account local farmers' perceptions of climate change and consider first the adequacy of CSA practices for the specific conditions of the target area before its promotion. This study is thus useful for many REDD+ initiatives that are currently being promoted in DRC and particularly in the Tshopo Province. Originality/value This study is one of the first studies to focus on CSA in the Yangambi landscape, DRC. It assists the use of agriculture as a response to reducing deforestation while at the same time lowering agriculture's carbon footprint and promoting a resilient and more productive farming system."," Dimensions: Climate-smart agriculture, Climate change mitigation and adaptation,

Many early career researchers (ECRs) have the capacity and drive to contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation solutions. Strategic investments in training and support, especially in broad-based efforts that span traditional disciplinary boundaries, can help ECRs meet this potential and become emerging leaders equipped to address pressing climate-related challenges throughout their careers. In 2018, the inaugural USDA Northeast Climate Hub's Graduate Climate Adaptation Partners (GradCAP) Program was launched to provide professional development opportunities and a platform for collaboration to graduate students studying climate resilience in agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture. This essay represents the unified voice of this consortium of emerging leaders. Here we offer perspectives, experiences, and recommendations for building capacity among ECRs, specifically with regard to interdisciplinary research, long-term research, and community engagement. We discuss these three tenants, which we term Convergence, Continuity, and Community, as essential elements in the development of successful leaders prepared for the complex challenges ahead. We encourage institutions, particularly universities and government agencies, to commit resources and pursue structural changes to provide support for mentorship and training that span these focal areas. As a result, more ECRs will have the capacity to engage in meaningful solution-oriented research and make lasting societal contributions toward the sustainable production of food and other natural resources in a changing climate.","

While new and ambitious environmental and climate change-oriented goals are being introduced in Europe, the monitoring of these objectives is often jeopardized by a lack of technological means and a reliance on heavy administrative procedures. In particular, remote sensing technologies have the potential to significantly improve the monitoring of such goals but the characteristics of such missions should take into consideration the needs of users to guarantee return on investments and effective policy implementation. This study aims at identifying gaps in the current offer of Copernicus products for the monitoring of the agricultural sector through the elicitation of stakeholder requirements. The methodology is applied to the case study of Italy while the approach is scalable at European level. The elicitation process associates user needs to the European and national legislative framework to create a policy-oriented demand of Copernicus Earth Observation services. Results show the limitations faced by environmental managers in relation to the use of Remote Sensing technologies and the shortcomings associated with a purely technology driven approach to the development of satellite missions. Through the introduction of this flexible and user centred approach instead, this paper provides a clear overview of agro-environmental user requirements and represents the basis for the definition of an integrated agricultural service.","

In 2012 Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) implemented the national 10-year Conservation and Management Strategy for the Elephant in Kenya, which includes an action aimed at testing whether beehive fences can be used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. From 2012 to 2015, we field-tested the efficacy of beehive fences to protect 10 0.4-ha farms next to Tsavo East National Park from elephants. We hung a series of beehives every 10 m around the boundary of each farm plot. The hives were linked with strong wire. After an initial pilot test with 2 farms, the remaining 8 of 10 beehive fences also contained 2-dimensional dummy hives between real beehives to help reduce the cost of the fence. Each trial plot had a neighboring control plot of the same size within the same farm. Of the 131 beehives deployed 88% were occupied at least once during the 3.5-year trial. Two hundred and fifty-three elephants, predominantly 20-45 years old entered the community farming area, typically during the crop-ripening season. Eighty percent of the elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas protected by the beehive fences, and elephants that broke a fence were in smaller than average groups. Beehive fences not only kept large groups of elephants from invading the farmland plots but the farmers also benefited socially and financially from the sale of 228 kg of elephant-friendly honey. As news of the success of the trial spread, a further 12 farmers requested to join the project, bringing the number of beehive fence protected farms to 22 and beehives to 297. This demonstrates positive adoption of beehive fences as a community mitigation tool. Understanding the response of elephants to the beehive fences, the seasonality of crop raiding and fence breaking, and the willingness of the community to engage with the mitigation method will help contribute to future management strategies for this high human-elephant conflict hotspot and other similar areas in Kenya.","

Advice delivery is one mechanism that can be used to encourage the uptake of water pollution mitigation measures amongst the farming community, but determining who is best placed to effectively provide advice and increase adoption creates a challenge for policy-makers. Through in-depth interviews, this research investigates the perspectives of both farmers and farm advisers on the delivery of water pollution mitigation advice in three agriculturally contrasting areas of England. A novel approach using word clouds as a visual comparative tool for qualitative data is presented to demonstrate a transferable method for disseminating research findings to a wider audience outside of academia. Results from the interviews indicate differences across the regions, and that contrasts exist between farmers and advisers' perceptions. This suggests it is important to assess both perspectives when designing effective advice delivery mechanisms and for policy-makers to consider who is most appropriate to effectively deliver farm advice."," Dimensions: Water pollution mitigation measures,

On this basis, five main scenarios were specified for agricultural commodity prices and crop yields. An economic agricultural sector model was used in order to assess the impacts of the scenarios on production, land use and farm income in Finland. The results suggest that falling crop yields, if realized due to low prices and restrictive policies, will result in decreasing crop and livestock production and increasing nutrient surplus. Slowly increasing crop yields could stabilise production and increase farm income. Significantly higher crop prices and yields are required, however, for any marked increase in production in Finland. Cereals production would increase relatively more than livestock production, if there were high prices for agricultural products. This is explained by abundant land resources, a high opportunity cost of labour and policies maintaining current dairy and beef production.","

Weather and climate extremes affect food crop production of women farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Women farmers use specific adaptation strategies to respond to weather and climate extremes confronting them. Most studies on the role of gender in the uptake of adaptation strategies have focused on gender differentiation and the ex-ante adaptation strategies that women farmers in Ghana use to respond to climate extremes. The aim of the present study is to analyze the ex-post targeted strategies women farmers' use to respond to weather and climate extremes, and the factors that explain the use of those strategies. The study estimated a multivariate probit model to analyze the problem using a cross-sectional data collected from sample of women farmers who have been exposed to climate extremes in the Upper West Region of Ghana. The study revealed that the women farmers used changing of planting dates as targeted adaptation strategy in response to drought, creation of drains and moving away from flood-prone areas as targeted adaptation strategies in response to flood, and creation of fire belts around farms as targeted adaptation strategy in response to bushfire. The study further identified the age of the farmer, climate information, asset holdings, credit and agricultural extension services as important determinants of the various ex-post targeted strategies the women farmers used to adapt to weather extremes in the region. The study recommends that policy should promote the uptake of adaptation strategies among women farmers through the removal of institutional barriers on the use of climate information, credit acquisition, liquid asset holdings, and agricultural extension services. Profiling the age of women farmers before targeting them with specific adaptation interventions is also a necessary policy instrument."," Dimensions: Climate extremes, Adaptation strategies, Gender differentiation

Dryland farming is highly affected by climate variability as its coefficient of variation with precipitation is high. The vulnerability assessment is a useful and effective tool for determining the impact of climate change on dryland farmers towards adaptation. The factors assessment plays an important role in designing and implementing policy research on a local scale in developing nations. The study aims to calculate the vulnerability level and factors affecting it in the dryland community in Southern India using Vulnerability index calculation and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary data were collected with a structured questionnaire from randomly selected 200 farming households from ten villages. This study introduced new contextual variables in the vulnerability assessment and compared different ML techniques to analyse the vulnerability factors. The study showed that the dryland community is moderately vulnerable because of its higher adaptive capacity. The results of the ML techniques showed that the factors ""Involvement in the awareness programmes, income sources for food, farm size, and education status of the dryland farmers"" had a significant impact on the vulnerability level of the community. Potential coping strategies were identified to reduce the vulnerability level of the dryland farmers. The present study showed a pathway that can help the policy research and development plan for the sustainable livelihood of dryland farmers at a micro-level in the climate-changing scenario.","

Nineteen environmental and socio-economic indicators are identified to reflect the three components of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results of the study show that the regions most exposed to climate change and variability do not always overlap with those experiencing high sensitivity or low adaptive capacity. Furthermore, vulnerability to climate change and variability is intrinsically linked with social and economic development. The Western Cape and Gauteng provinces, which have high levels of infrastructure development, high literacy rates, and low shares of agriculture in total GDP, are relatively low on the vulnerability index. In contrast, the highly vulnerable regions of Limpopo, Kwazulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape are characterised by densely populated rural areas, large numbers of small-scale farmers, high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and high land degradation. These large differences in the extent of vulnerability among provinces suggest that policymakers should develop region-specific policies and address climate change at the local level."," Dimensions: Exposure, Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity

Despite strides in such efforts, there is a paucity of research on levels of awareness and use of climate services by farmers. Understanding these nuances can illuminate important pathways for improving climate service uptake and delivery for favourable social and economic development outcomes. In this paper, we used a mixed-method approach to assess the factors influencing climate service uptake among farmers (N = 356) in one of Jamaica's principal agricultural regions, Clarendon. Regression analysis techniques were used to specifically determine the likelihood of farmers' awareness, access and use of locally developed climate services disseminated via TV/radio, climate text message, online farmer bulletin, and community-specific forecast across fifteen (15) social and environmental variables. Eight (8) factors were found to have significant influence on climate service awareness, access, and use (p < 0.05). These include gender, age, access to extension service, participation in groups/organizations, climate change perceptions, non-farm income, farm size, and agronomic conditions. The active use of the climate and weather information was closely linked to farmers' experiential observation of the relevance of the information within their own immediate context. Qualitative case study analyses further highlighted socio-spatial patterns of inequalities in CIS use, being dominated by the younger, more educated demographic. These results highlight potential entry points for increased tailoring of the design and delivery of agro-climate service products for greater effectiveness in climate service delivery. Given the projected impacts of increased climate variability on Caribbean agricultural systems, learning how farmers interact with agro-climate service products can surface opportunities to increase uptake and strengthen resilience.","

In this paper we produce projections of seasonal precipitation for four Mediterranean areas: Apulia region (Italy), Ebro river basin (Spain), Po valley (Italy) and Antalya province (Turkey). We performed the statistical downscaling using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) in two versions: in one case Principal Component Analysis (PCA) filter is applied only to predictor and in the other to both predictor and predictand. After performing a validation test, CCA after PCA filter on both predictor and predictand has been chosen. Sea level pressure (SLP) is used as predictor.

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural sources have a significant role in the overall enhancement of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) effect. In research, measurements of GHG emissions are made to improve upon emission factors used in national inventories, identify and promote mitigation practices, and drive policy on GHG emissions in agriculture. These measurements are fundamental to the process of better management of GHG emissions. There is a variety of measurement techniques used in GHG research depending on the measurement environment and available resources. Techniques that use chambers or micrometeorological measurements are commonly employed for calculating emissions of GHG from point sources in agriculture, such as livestock and manure-holding facilities. This review examines these techniques, their limitations, and discusses methods to quantify their accuracy and precision. Emerging techniques like the use of dispersion models provide opportunities to directly determine emissions from whole farms. A few micrometeorological techniques (integrated horizontal flux and mass difference) are ideal for point sources such as manure storage facilities. For smaller sources, chambers are still recommended. In designing GHG emission studies, employing more than one technique when measuring GHG emissions is recommended, as often differences can exist due to technique. Ideally, a controlled release of the target gas, and its recovery, should also be conducted to evaluate techniques prior to their application. Although many techniques are often sensitive enough to quantify mitigation practices, i.e., the relative change in emissions, it is more difficult to determine ""true"" emission factors as required for inventory work. It follows that the precision and accuracy of the techniques must accompany their application when estimating GHG emissions.","

The Mesoamerican Agroenvironmental Program (MAP-Norway) is a multi-dimensional rural development program implemented in Central America since 2009, working with smallholder families, producer organizations, governmental organizations, and regional governance platforms. To monitor, assess, and evaluate the effects of the program on its beneficiaries, MAP-Norway uses a series of indicators that allow project managers and donors to adapt and follow-up on the interventions. Because gender is a cross-cutting theme in the program, gender indicators are used at all levels: families, producer organizations, and governmental organizations and governance platforms. In this document, we use the experience of MAP-Norway to critically assess these indicators, considering their potential usability in the monitoring and evaluation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) initiatives. Furthermore, we propose a series of other indicators that capture various dimensions of gender relations. These indicators can be used to assess the effect of CSA practices, services, and technologies on equity in decision-making, women's empowerment (including economic empowerment), intra-household food security, and equity in ownership over productive resources, among others, thus providing evidence that can help better design and target CSA interventions.","

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of time and amount of hog manure application on farm productivity and GHG emissions from a cow-calf production system using two whole-farm models. Detailed model inputs (climate, soil and manure properties, farm operation data) were collected from a 3-year field study that evaluated the following three treatments: no application of hog manure on grassland (baseline); a single application of hog manure on grassland in spring (single); and two applications of hog manure as fall and spring (split). All three treatments were simulated in a representative cow-calf production system at the farm-gate using the following whole-farm models: a Coupled Components Model (CCM) that used existing farm component models and the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). Annual GHG intensities for the baseline scenario were 17.7 kg CO2-eq/kg liveweight for CCM and 18.1 kg CO2-eq/kg liveweight for IFSM. Of the total farm GHG emissions, 73-77% were from enteric methane production. The application of hog manure on grassland showed a mean emission increase of 7.8 and 8.4 kg CO2-eq/kg liveweight above the baseline for the single and split scenarios, respectively. For the manured scenarios, farm GHG emissions were mainly from enteric methane (47-54%) and soil nitrous oxide (33-41%). Emission estimates from the different GHG sources in the farm varied between models for the single and split application scenarios. Although farm productivity was 3-4% higher in the split than in single application (0.14 t liveweight/ha), the environmental advantage of applying manure in a single or split application was not consistent between models for farm emission intensity. Further component and whole-farm assessments are required to fully understand the impact of timing and the amount of livestock manure application on GHG emissions from beef production systems.","

Climate change is anticipated to increase the duration and the magnitude of drought events, augmenting also their adverse effects. Recent studies, as well as policy initiatives, emphasise the need of proper farm-level management, for efficient mitigation of drought effects and adaptation to climate change. Towards this objective, robust, practical and comprehensible tools should be employed to support decision making process.

The proposed CRDI is an adjustment of the widely used Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), in which the utilised parameter of reference evapotranspiration is replaced by crop evapotranspiration. Along with this amendment, other issues regarding the calculation of CRDI are discussed, such as the selection of appropriate reference periods and methods of crop evapotranspiration assessment. The significance and the advantages of CRDI are illustrated through an application, considering different crops under Mediterranean conditions, in three regions of Greece.","

In Tunisia, farm households are facing several climate-driven risks including drought, which ends up with a decrease in their farm productivity and therefore threatens their livelihood subsistence. However, there is a knowledge gap on how household livelihoods are vulnerable and how this vulnerability varies among them. The main purpose of the paper was to assess the households' livelihood vulnerability to climate change in Medenine province of South-East Tunisia using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). Data were gathered using a monitoring system with 39 reference farms identified by a typology carried out with the data of 2185 farm households from the last survey of farm structures in Medenine-Tunisia. The typological approach identified four farm households' types: T1: livestock farming with family labor, T2: livestock farming with waged labor, T3: plant production with family labor, and T4: plant production with waged labor. Using the LVI method, results suggest that T1 and T3 are more vulnerable, particularly about knowledge and skills, farm capital, finances, institutional aspects, social network, and water. The findings of the study could help policymakers in designing specific adaptation measures to reduce the household's vulnerability. The government should give specific attention to T1 and T3 households through: (i) establishing a mechanism that distribute aids to the most affected households, (ii) sustaining the households' livelihoods by improving water supply and encouraging crop diversification and seed production, and (iii) developing an early warning system for climate extremes."," Dimensions: Livelihood vulnerability, Climate change, Climate-driven risks, Farm productivity

The overall objective is to demonstrate SEA as a systematic and structured policy, plan, and program (PPP) decision support tool. In order to accomplish this objective, a stakeholder-based SEA application to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policy options in Canadian agriculture is presented. Using a mail-out impact assessment exercise, agricultural producers and nonproducers from across the Canadian prairie region were asked to evaluate five competing GHG mitigation options against 13 valued environmental components (VECs). Data were analyzed using multi-criteria and exploratory analytical techniques. The results suggest considerable variation in perceived impacts and GHG mitigation policy preferences, suggesting that a blanket policy approach to GHG mitigation will create gainers and losers based on soil type and associate cropping and on-farm management practices. It is possible to identify a series of regional greenhouse gas mitigation programs that are robust, socially meaningful, and operationally relevant to both agricultural producers and policy decision makers. The assessment demonstrates the ability of SEA to address, in an operational sense, environmental problems that are characterized by conflicting interests and competing objectives and alternatives. A structured and systematic SEA methodology provides the necessary decision support framework for the consideration of impacts, and allows for PPPs to be assessed based on a much broader set of properties, objectives, criteria, and constraints whereas maintaining rigor and accountability in the assessment process.","

82,415750868,gpt_checked,"Using a livelihoods framework to analyze farmer identity and decision making during the Central American coffee leaf rust outbreak: implications for addressing climate change and crop diversification This qualitative study of one Guatemalan coffee cooperative examined the decision making process of smallholder farmers as they struggled to preserve their livelihoods during an outbreak of coffee leaf rust (CLR). The results revealed that although the cooperative members viewed the CLR as a threat to livelihoods, it was no greater a threat than other crises such as low coffee prices, extreme weather events, and persistent food insecurity. In response, members suspended organic coffee production, borrowed money to purchase food, sought off-farm employment, and grew limited subsistence crops. Yet most interestingly, for the long-term, they remained fully committed to producing high quality arabica coffee even though the cooperative was aware a future CLR outbreak could again devastate production. These findings question the underlying assumption of crop diversification initiatives which rarely consider the importance of farmer identity. Crop diversification and off-farm employment schemes seek to mitigate environmental threats (e.g., climate change) that smallholder farmers face, however this research shows that farmer identity can be just as, if not more, important than crop yields or even income generation. The authors propose a three-stage smallholder producer vulnerability framework to better understand and analyze future livelihoods disruptions of smallholder producers.","

We implement these measures using coupled, site-specific ecosystem and economic simulation models. This modeling approach has two key features needed to study the response of agricultural production systems to climate change: it represents adaptation as an endogenous, non-marginal economic response to climate change; and it provides the capability to represent the spatial variability in bio-physical and economic conditions that interact with adaptive responses. We apply this approach to the dryland grain production systems of the Northern Plains region of the United States. The results support the hypothesis that the most adverse impacts on net returns distributions tend to occur in the areas with the poorest resource endowments and when mitigating effects of CO2 fertilization and adaptation are absent. We find that relative and absolute measures of vulnerability depend on complex interactions between climate change, CO2 level, adaptation, and economic conditions such as relative output prices. The relationship between relative vulnerability and resource endowments varies with assumptions about climate change, adaptation, and economic conditions. Vulnerability measured with respect to an absolute threshold is inversely related to resource endowments in all cases investigated."," Dimensions: Adaptation, spatial heterogeneity, vulnerability of agricultural systems to climate change and CO2 fertilization

84,415750870,gpt_checked,"The ambiguous role of agri-environment-climate measures in the safeguarding of High Nature Value Farming Systems: The case of the Montado in Portugal The preservation of High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) is essential for meeting many of the new European Union (EU) Green Deal targets, as they correspond to production systems which respect the preservation of natural resources and support multiple ecosystem services. However, most of the farming systems on which HNVf rely cannot survive without support from public policies. Typically, these are low intensity and low agrochemical input systems, such as the Montado in southern Portugal, a silvo-pastoral land use system adapted to the Mediterranean constraints encountered in the region. Agri-environment-climate measures (AECM) within the EU Common Agricultural Policy, despite their multiple objectives, provide great potential for supporting the conservation of HNVf. However, for this to happen, the measures in place must ensure the maintenance of the low intensity farming practices that led to the HNV status of these systems in the first place. Using an extensive cattle production system in a Montado area as a case study, this paper assesses whether if the implementation of the AECM for Integrated production and the AECM for Organic production, are indeed supporting a less intensive management of this multifunctional land use system and, thus, its HNV. These are two well-known horizontal measures, which can be applied across all farmland and are therefore of major relevance in promoting environmental performance of farming across the EU. The results of our study show that overall, none of these AECM is promoting less intensive management practices in Montado areas, and they therefore do not contribute to the conservation of their natural value. Furthermore, the results underline the importance of grazing management to understand the ongoing changes in many Montado areas. Lastly, the results also show that horizontal AECM are barely able to provide consistent environmental benefits in systems with a high level of complexity as found in silvo-pastoral systems.","

Regression relationships between MUN, UUN, and NH3 emissions were compiled from studies conducted in Wisconsin, California, and the Netherlands. Relative reductions in NH3 emissions were calculated as percentage decreases in NH3 emissions associated with a baseline MUN level of 14 mg/dL (prevailing industry average). For 3 studies with cows in stanchion barns, relative NH3 emission reductions of 10.3 to 28.2% were obtained when MUN declined from 14 to 10 mg/dL. Similarly, analyses of 2 freestall studies provided relative NH3 emission reductions of 10.5 to 33.7% when MUN levels declined from 14 to 10 mg/dL. The relative reductions in NH3 emissions from both stanchion and freestall barns can be associated directly with reductions in UUN excretion, which can be determined using MUN. The results of this study may help create new awareness, and perhaps eventual industry-based incentives, for management practices that enhance feed N use efficiency and reduce MUN, UUN, and NH3 emissions from dairy farms.","

Eighteen calculators were assessed. These calculators were designed for different aims and to be used in different geographical areas and they use slightly different accounting methodologies. The classification proposed is based on the main aim of the assessment: raising awareness, reporting, project evaluation or product assessment. When the aims have been clearly formulated, the most suitable calculator can be selected from the comparison tables, taking account of the geographical area and the scope of the calculation as well as the time and skills required for the calculation. The main issues for interpreting GHG assessments are discussed, highlighting the difficulty of comparing the results obtained from different calculators, mainly owing to differences in scope, calculation methods and reporting units. A major problem is the poor accounting for land use change; the calculators are usually able to account satisfactorily for other emission sources. One of the main challenges at landscape-scale level is to produce a realistic assessment of the various production systems as the uncertainty levels are very high. The results should always give some indication of the link between GHG emissions and the productivity of the area, although no single indicator is able to encompass all the services produced by agriculture and forestry (e.g. food, goods, landscape value and revenue).","

This study evaluated the impacts of future climate scenarios on the groundwater resources and agricultural economy of the Texas High Plains, using Hale county as a case study. Climate change impacts were incorporated into regional economic models using weather projections to develop crop response functions from crop models. These projections are based on quantitative projections of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and temperature trends driven by simulations from the latest IPCC AR4 climate models (Community Climate System Model (CCSM), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), UK Met Office Hadley Model (HadCM3), and Parallel Climate Model (PCM)) under two specific emissions scenarios, A1B (mid-range) and A1FI (higher). Results indicated that for both the emission scenarios, saturated thickness, water use per cropland acre, and irrigated acreage declined under climatic predictions by all four models. At the end of the 90 year horizon, the A1B scenario resulted in a decline in average net income per acre as predicted by the CCSM and HadCM3 models, while the GFDL and PCM models predicted an increase in average net income per acre. Under the A1FI scenario, the CCSM, GFDL, and PCM model projections led to increased average net income per acre, while climate projections under the HadCM3 model indicated a decline in average net income per acre at the end of the 90 year horizon."," Dimensions: Sustainable agriculture and food systems, UNCLEAR

Resilience-based approaches to climate change have yet to be widely applied in agriculture. In this sector, indicators have been centered on the impacts of climate on production systems, crops, yields, infrastructure, financial performance, farmers' livelihoods and food security. This paper focuses on designing an indicator set to capture the resilience of agriculture to inform decision-making frameworks and policies. The indicators' selection and definition were driven by their relevance for decision-making through the combined knowledge of policy and information priorities on climate change impacts and vulnerabilities as well as pragmatic issues relating to data availability. In total, 36 indicators were selected covering the following areas: regional drivers of the change to the agricultural sector (demographics, agricultural markets, climate); farmland production activities (food and feed); non-farm economy; and primary outcomes (off-farm net income, numerous environmental services). By coordinating this process among policy-makers with different roles in regional planning, we were able to identify shared information needs among the various sectoral representatives. The indicator selection process also captured policy gaps potential responses that could increase resilience and feed directly into policy reviews, thereby strengthening integration of actions across sectors. This indicator set emphasizes that the relationships between government agencies and both industry and academia may be improved by addressing gaps in data availability, accessibility, and privacy constraints.","

Assessments of climate change impacts on agriculture are increasingly relying on panel models to examine the relationship between agricultural outcomes and weather fluctuations. This article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of such models. We argue that panel models are ideal for assessing climate impacts on agriculture because they use group fixed effects to absorb all time-invariant variation and thus rely on weather deviations from the mean that are random and exogenous. Using this random and exogenous source of variation is crucial to identifying a causal relationship between agricultural outcomes and weather. In addition, the large number of observations offered by a panel data set allows the identification of a nonlinear response function, which is an important step in modeling the effects of climate change, as the response can be highly nonlinear. Despite these strengths of panel models, they may still suffer from omitted variable biases of time-varying variables, such as pollution shocks, which are correlated with the weather shocks. Moreover, because group fixed effects absorb a lot of the signal in the weather variables, the signal:noise ratio might decrease. Thus researchers should be careful when constructing the weather variables in order to avoid having noise in the data that causes downward biases in the coefficients.","

From a survey of 45 SSFAs, representing +2700 farmers, drought emerged as the most significant stress. Droughts result in failed cane germination, increased pests and increased diseases. Farmers indicated that there had no land title deeds and were concerned about the poor state of infield and feeder roads damaged during heavy rainfall and floods. It emerged that the bulk of the SSFAs irrigate during the day, a scenario that leaves them vulnerable to high temperatures leading to high evapotranspiration. In addition, 97% of the SSFAs sampled did not have drought preparedness plans and likewise, all did not have a flood management plan. About 76% of SSFAs operation costs goes to crop upkeep and harvesting, with labour cost increases attributed to extreme weather events. All sampled SSFAs had no insurance against loss from extreme weather events. Given the foregone, the paper recommends that the government fast tracks the 1999 Draft Land Policy intended to address the issue of title deeds. The paper further suggest that extension officers and farmers be trained to sharpen skills on understanding climate change."," Dimensions: Climate change vulnerability, Sustainable Livelihoods Framework

This is a discussion of the available technology for measuring turbulent fluxes using instrumented towers. This review focuses on the flux measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) for agricultural systems and the development of standards and protocols for measuring them. Agroccosystems present unique challenges because they undergo large leaf area index (LAI) and canopy architecture changes in a relatively short period of time (i.e., months) coupled with the fact that many of the greenhouse gas sources are diffuse. This review examines all aspects of the theory and application of the micrometeorological techniques, with focus on the flux gradient, eddy accumulation and eddy covariance techniques. Instrument placement, sensor response and noise characteristics are also explored. Innovative applications of micrometeorological methods are discussed for closed- and open-path trace gas sensors and commonly used meteorological instrumentation. The use of fast-response single-pass optical tunable diode laser (i.e., CH4, N2O) and infrared gas analyzers (i.e., CO2, H2O) is described. Consideration is also taken of the trace gas sensors' flow system design, mixing ratio measurement, and data acquisition and reduction requirements for micrometeorological flux measurement. Procedures are outlined for the meteorological instrumentation necessary for eddy covariance-based energy budget measurement including ultrasonic anemometry.","

Because emission measurement is difficult and expensive, process-based models provide an alternative for estimating whole farm emissions. A model that simulates the processes of NH3 formation, speciation, aqueous-gas partitioning, and mass transfer was developed and incorporated in a whole farm simulation model (the Integrated Farm System Model). Farm sources included manure on the floor of the housing facility, manure in storage (if used), field-applied manure, and deposits on pasture (if grazing is used). In a comprehensive evaluation of the model, simulated daily, seasonal, and annual emissions compared well with data measured over 2 yr for five free stall barns and two manure storages on dairy farms in the eastern United States. In a further comparison with published data, simulated and measured barn emissions were similar over differing barn designs, protein feeding levels, and seasons of the year. Simulated emissions from manure storage were also highly correlated with published emission data across locations, seasons, and different storage covers. For field applied manure, the range in simulated annual emissions normally bounded reported mean values for different manure dry matter contents and application methods. Emissions from pastures measured in northern Europe across seasons and fertilization levels were also represented well by the model. After this evaluation, simulations of a representative dairy farm in Pennsylvania illustrated the effects of animal housing and manure management on whole farm emissions and their interactions with greenhouse gas emissions, nitrate leaching, production costs, and farm profitability.","

Furthermore, future projections of the considered indices until the end of the 21st century are analyzed for two greenhouse gas scenarios (Representative Concentrations Pathways RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The validation reveals good results for indices that are based on one or two climate variables only and on simple temporal aggregations. Indices that involve multiple climate variables, complex temporal statistics or extreme conditions are less well represented. The climate projection analysis indicates an intensification of temperature-related extreme events such as heat waves. In general, climate change signals in the indices considered are subject to three main patterns: a horizontal pattern across Switzerland, a vertical pattern depending on elevation and a temporal pattern with an intensification of change in the course of the 21st century. Changes are in most cases more pronounced for the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario compared to the mitigation scenario RCP2.6. Overall, the projections indicate a challenging 21st century climate for the agricultural sector. Our findings furthermore show the value and the necessity of a robust validation of climate scenario products to enable trustworthy and valuable impact analyses, especially for more complex indices and models.","

This study proposes a novel index to evaluate agricultural vulnerability to climate change in coastal areas, using the case of Andhra Pradesh, the state with the second longest coastline in India. Field data was collected from more than 1000 farmers (involved in over 50 varieties of crops) in 22 riverine and coastal case study areas. Data was collected through site visits, surveys and five workshops conducted between November 2018 and June 2019. Based on the collected data sets, a new Agricultural Coastal Vulnerability Index (AGCVI) was developed and applied to the 22 sites located in two districts (Krishna and Guntur) of Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The analysis revealed that the areas with three crop seasons (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) per year are highly vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, sites with one crop season (Kharif) per annum are the least vulnerable to climate change. Moreover, grains (particularly rice), flowers and fruit crops are more susceptible to climate change and its induced impacts. Rice is no longer a profitable crop in the case study areas partly as a result of unfavourable weather conditions, inadequate insurance provision and lack of government support for farmers. Cumulatively, all these circumstances impact farmers' incomes and socio-cultural practices: this is leading to a marriage crisis, with a reduction in the desirability of matrimony to farmers. These findings provide valuable information that can support climate and agriculture policies, as well as sustainable cropping patterns among farmers' communities in coastal areas of India in the future.","

97,415750936,gpt_checked,"Linking agricultural crop management and air quality models for regional to national-scale nitrogen assessments. While nitrogen (N) is an essential element for life, human population growth and demands for energy, transportation and food can lead to excess nitrogen in the environment. A modeling framework is described and implemented to promote a more integrated, process-based and system-level approach to the estimation of ammonia (NH3) emissions which result from the application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers to agricultural soils in the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is used to simulate plant demand-driven fertilizer applications to commercial cropland throughout the continental US. This information is coupled with a process-based air quality model to produce continental-scale NH3 emission estimates. Regional cropland NH3 emissions are driven by the timing and amount of inorganic NH3 fertilizer applied, soil processes, local meteorology, and ambient air concentrations. Initial fertilizer application often occurs when crops are planted. A state-level evaluation of EPIC-simulated, cumulative planted area compares well with similar USDA reported estimates. EPIC-annual, inorganic fertilizer application amounts also agree well with reported spatial patterns produced by others, but domain-wide the EPIC values are biased about 6% low. Preliminary application of the integrated fertilizer application and air quality modeling system produces a modified geospatial pattern of seasonal NH3 emissions that improves current simulations of observed atmospheric particle nitrate concentrations. This modeling framework provides a more dynamic, flexible, and spatially and temporally resolved estimate of NH3 emissions than previous factor-based NH3 inventories, and will facilitate evaluation of alternative nitrogen and air quality policy and adaptation strategies associated with future climate and land use changes.","

98,415750937,gpt_checked,"Adaptation measures to climate change as perceived by smallholder farmers in the andes. Events related to the global effects of climate change (CC) have impacted smallholder farmers from developing countries more severely than any other group. This paper presents the case of Colombian Andean Altiplano farmers who are increasingly exposed to the impacts of a highly variable climate, yet have developed adaptation and coping strategies in their farms to reduce it. Semi-structured and structured interviews were held with 27 smallholders at the beginning and at the end of one year; over this period, two participant-observation sessions were also conducted on each farm. According to smallholders, CC is manifested by a modification in the seasons and the amount and frequency of night frosts, droughts, and rainfall. Smallholders utilized 13 on-farm strategies, the most reported of which were polyculture, water management, and soil conservation. Our research also found a high diversity of crops (47 species and 79 varieties), and mixed smallholder perceptions of these crops to climate variability vulnerability. Notably, most of their important species were vulnerable cash crops. The relevant off-farm strategies were: land tenure, whereby more adaptation strategies were applied by owners than tenants; membership in smallholder associations that promoted shared strategies; and off-farm work to diversify their incomes. Altiplano smallholders are adapting to CC by employing the tools that are available to them; those practices have helped to ensure Colombia's food security, largely without public institutional and private sector participation.","

99,415750938,gpt_checked,"Environmental assessment of cucumber farming using energy and greenhouse gas emission indexes. Energy and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions evaluation is from the most common methods for assessment of environmental status of production activities. In this study energy and GHG balance in the greenhouse cucumber production in Yazd province of Iran were assessed. Data of this study were collected using a face to face questionnaire method from the farmers growing cucumber crops. Study results showed that the average annual crop yield of the greenhouses was 89868.54 kg/ha which demanded an average energy input of 699217.04 MJ/ha. Diesel fuel and electricity were the biggest energy consumers in the farms with shares of 59.31 and 25.58% of total input energy. These two inputs also were the biggest air pollutant with the emissions of 33128.65 and 62309.23 kg CO2-eq per hectare respectively. The results also showed that a quadratic model was the best for modeling the relations between the crop yield and total energy input, GHG per yield and energy intensity; and linear model was the best for modeling relation between yield and energy productivity.","
