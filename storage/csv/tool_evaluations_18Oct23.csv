This was done to transform the values from zero to one to be comparable. Adaptive capacity was assumed to be a function of the sub-indices and indicators identified under the SLF.Weights were assigned to the sub-indices and indicators using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). PCA addresses concerns on the arbitrary use of numeric equality in equal weighting and the subjectivity of assigning weights through expert judgement. The loadings for each run of PCA (principal component) describe the contribution or relative importance (taken as weights) of each indicator to the sub-index and each sub-index to the HACI. Only the first principal components (loadings of the first run of PCA) were used since this explained majority of the variation in the data set. First, PCA was run for the indicators under each sub-index to determine the relative importance (weights) of each indicator. The normalized indicator values were multiplied by the generated weights to calculate the sub-indices. Second-step PCA was then run to generate the weights of the five sub-indices in relation to the HACI. The normalized sub-indices were multiplied by the weights. Finally, HACI was calculated by adding the values of the five sub-indices. In this approach, a higher HACI indicates higher adaptive capacity of the farming household. While the HACI is not an absolute measurement of adaptive capacity, it allows comparability among the households included in the study. PCA was run at the Institute of Statistics of the University of the Philippines Los Banos using the SAS 9.1 software.",NA,Once,Complete

Resilience refers not only to the capacity to absorb stress and shocks as a system, but also to the capacity for self-organization and learning among system actors. In this way, resilience is a dynamic concept (Ericksen et al., 2010), accounting for fast and slow changes that must be addressed at multiple interaction scales (Anderies et al., 2006).

""In the international literature, some previous studies have attempted to apply the concept of the BSC to agriculture. These attempts existed in Denmark, German, Ireland, New Zealand, Ukraine, the UK, the USA, Italy, and Australia in various agribusiness sectors, including milk and animal production, fruit cooperatives, and food supply chains [4,13,30 38]. Literature on the Balanced Scorecard application in the agricultural sector is not abundant. Most BSC literature focuses on the corporate sector [4]. One critical factor that limited the large-scale adoption of the Balanced Scorecard in agribusiness seemed to be the predominance of small family farms, which rely mostly on physical work and lack formal strategic management [39]. However, the BSC is not excluded as a valuable tool for family farm business, and several studies have demonstrated that the application of the Balanced Scorecard in small and medium family farms could be successful [4,30 34,36].",Once,Complete

Today, the three-pillar model of sustainability is widely applied, and not only in the agricultural sphere, but in industry and in the evaluation of businesses as well. Here, the aim is to simultaneously improve environmental and socioeconomic sustainability. Often, however, the optimal achievement of all objectives is not possible.

The matrix of the pairwise comparisons gave rise to the vector of weights that, through a mathematical elaboration, were finally transformed into numbers whose sum must be 1 (or 100, depending on the scale used). AHP is based on pairwise comparisons of objectives and alternatives, from which the alternatives are ranked according to relative importance. With pairwise comparisons, the decision maker considers only two objectives at a time and the process of weighting objectives is thus facilitated [26].

Alike, sustainable agriculture emphasizes long-term endurance of efficiency in the factors of production from environmental, economic and social perspectives and concentrates on the supply of nutritional needs of the mankind (Hansen 1996; Rao and Rogers, 2006). Additionally, sustainable agriculture focuses on the best channels of preserving the environment and natural resources. In other words, stewardship of the natural habitat is as much crucial as the production and profitability in the frame of sustainable agriculture. Moreover, sustainable agriculture declines the dependency of the production process on the inputs destructive for the environment, and therefore, agriculture-based en viron - mental pollution is reduced to minimum (De Koeijer et al., 2002; Gomes et al., 2008). in order to reach sustainability in an agricultural system, all the resources necessary for production should not only be used in the most efficient way, but output per input should be maximized as well.

CRA is a new model of agricultural management that follows the concept of sustainable development, and it aims to address hunger and poverty under climate change (Howden et al., 2007; Gentle and Maraseni, 2012; Reddy, 2015; Acevedo et al., 2020). Following sustainable development conception and using advanced technologies, CRA practices can alter the current situation and sustain agricultural production from the local to the global level, especially in a sustainable manner (Reddy, 2015; Srinivasa Rao et al., 2019; Acevedo et al., 2020). The IPCC defined climate resilience as the ability of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with climate change disturbances/challenges in a manner that maintains their essential structure, characteristics, and functions while maintaining an integrated capacity to adapt, learn and transform (Denton et al., 2014).",1; 2; 3; 4; 6; 7; 8; 9; 12; 13; 15; 16,Yes,Unknown,Performance-based,consultation/feedback incorporated,researchers,region,region,context-specific,NA,Large/commercial farm,Yes,researchers,ST; R,Unknown,Unknown,No,No,Expert consultation,Quantitative (measured); Quantitative (enumerator/farmer estimated) Qualitative (enumerator/farmer estimated),unknown,Medium,No restriction,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,NA,NA,Composite index,71,Unknown,Unknown,No,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Following indicator accessibility, three methods—direct calculation, model simulation, and expert scoring—were used to quantify each indicator. When assessing CRA, the z-score, StandardScaler, or MinMaxScaler methods can be used to normalize each indicator to eliminate the impact of indicators dimensions on the evaluation results. Using the normalized indicators, the indexes of productivity, income level, climate adaptability, and green development level were calculated using the weighted sum method. The CRA index was then evaluated using the comprehensive index method.",NA,Once,
